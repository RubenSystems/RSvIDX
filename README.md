# RSvIDX
The next generation vector indexing tool

 ### Vector indexing
RSvIDX can be used for general purpose vector indexing and similarity search. Applications include:
* Semantic search 
* Document deduplication 
* Recommendation 
* Classification 
* Image search 
* Reverse image search 
* Audio similarity (like Shazam)
* Q&A 


### Features 
- fast and efficient math library
- optimised persistant operations (you now no longer need to explicitly save the index as this is scheduled automatically)
- better memory performance
- no dependencies (new build size is 98% smaller)
